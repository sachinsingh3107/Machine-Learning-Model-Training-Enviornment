# Machine-Learning-Model-Training-Enviornment
The main idea of our application “MoTE” allows the user to perform all the tasks from data processing to model selection without writing a single line of code. With the help of a user friendly interface the application takes the data set as input, do all the computation and finally displays the score for the model.
